CS 255: System Analysis and Design – Portfolio Reflection

DriverPass Project Summary

  In the DriverPass project, the aim was to design a system that would be used by a company that provides assistance to students who are learning to drive. It was requested that we set up an online lesson system that allowed our client to schedule driving tests and lessons, and track the progress of their students online. As a result, they were looking for a tool that would be easy for students to use as well as assist instructors in managing their time and lessons better.
  
What I Did Well

  I believe I did a good job of capturing what the client wanted and putting it into clear diagrams and documents that were easy to understand. I am very proud of the way I was able to break down the business requirements into a way that was more structured and understandable, especially with my use case diagrams and system breakdowns that I created.
  
What I Would Improve

  It would have been nice if I could re-do one part, I would spend as much time polishing the UML diagrams as possible. There were a few that could have had more detail or a cleaner formatting so that they would have been easier to read at a glance. As well as labeling things more clearly next time, I would also make sure that there is a clear explanation for readers, so they know what is happening at all times.
  
How I Interpreted the User’s Needs

  It was important for me to spend a lot of time observing what the users students and instructors would need to do in order for the system to function as intended during the course of the design process. Because the client kept saying that ease of use was the top priority, I made sure the process of scheduling lessons and accessing materials was as straightforward as possible. I believe that it is extremely important to keep the user's needs in mind when designing a system, since even if a system is powerful, if it's too complicated, it won't be used by people.
  
My Approach to Software Design

  Usually, I start by asking myself, “What is the user trying to accomplish with this application? ”,” and then work backwards from there” I suggest you start from that point and work your way backwards from there. I use diagrams in order to visualize everything as soon as possible before I talk to the client, and I keep the lines of communication open throughout the process. In order to make sure I'm always designing something that solves the right problems in the right way, I will be utilizing methods such as user stories, mockups, and regular feedback.
